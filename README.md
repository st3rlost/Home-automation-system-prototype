# Home-automation-system-prototype

This project is a home automation prototype built using an ESP32. It allows you to control LEDs both physically via push buttons and remotely via a web interface. The project demonstrates how IoT can be used to integrate physical control with web-based automation.

-> Features:
  1. Control LEDs with push buttons (manual control).
  2. Control LEDs through a web page with ON/OFF buttons (remote control).
  3. Real-time synchronization between physical buttons and the web interface.
  4. Simple and lightweight web server hosted on the ESP32.

-> Hardware Requirements:
  1. ESP32 Development Board
  2. Push Buttons 
  3. LEDs x4
  4. Resistors
  5. Breadboard & Jumper Wires
  6. Power supply (USB )

-> Software Requirements:
  1. Arduino IDE (with ESP32 board support installed)
  2. ESPAsyncWebServer and AsyncTCP libraries (for web server functionality)

We can also expand this project further with motor drivers and better power supplies to connect with actual appliances.
